Text Mining Applications

Text mining has improved user experiences and business decisions. Most of the companies are using text mining tools to add value to their organization and products. Some application areas of text mining includes;

    Risk Management
    One of the main causes of business failure is due to lack of proper or insufficient risk analysis. Integrating risk management software powered by text mining technologies canhelp businesses to stay updated with all current trends in the market and boost their abilities to cover up the potential risks.

    Customer Care Service
    When the business system is integrated with text analytical tools, feedback systems, chatbots, online reviews, support tickets and social media profiles, it enables us to improve the customer experience with speed. Text mining and sentiment analysis can provide mechanisms for us to prioritize key points for our customer, allowing us to respond to urgent issues in real-time and helps to increase the customer satisfaction.

    Healthcare
    One of the major applications of text mining is the healthcare sector as it provides valuable information to the researchers. Manual investigation of medical research can be very costly and time consuming. As text mining provides an automation method for extracting the valuable information from the medical literature, it is becoming extremely popular in the medical field as well.

    Spam Filtering
    Text mining is used to filter and exclude the emails from inboxes and thus improving the overall user experiences. With the help of this application it reduces the risk of cyber attacks to the end users.

    Fraud Detection
    By combining the outcomes of the text analysis with relevant structured data we are able to process the user profile and claims efficiently as well as to detect and prevent frauds.
